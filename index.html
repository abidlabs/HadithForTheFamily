      <div class="hadith">I served the Prophet (ﷺ) for ten years, and he never said “Uff” to me, nor did he ever blame
        me by saying, “Why did you do so or why didn't you do so?” ― Anas

        <span class="emphasize">Apply it!</span> Be positive around your family and friends. If they do something that you do not like, then find a positive
        or humorous way to let them know instead of complaining. Cultivate gratitude. Take a moment right now to think about the
        positive qualities of the people around you. Verbally show your family love and appreciation on a regular basis.
